## My process

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

While working on this project, I significantly improved my understanding of responsive design, especially using Flexbox. Here's a CSS snippet that I'm particularly proud of:


```css
.qr-code-component {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
}


This project also reinforced the importance of mobile-first design and how to effectively use media queries to adapt the layout for larger screens.


### Continued development

I plan to focus on refining my skills in responsive design and start incorporating more complex JavaScript interactions in future projects. Additionally, I'm interested in exploring CSS Grid and modern layout techniques.
